    "So far, we have only used Python to implement the HTTP requests as they are described in the API documentation. This takes quite a bit of work, and we would have to do it all over again for the next API we want to use.\n",

    "Fortunately, there are Python libraries available for many APIs that do most of the work for us. How to use such so-called _API wrappers_ depends on the individual implementationm but it usually follows more or less the same pattern. In this notebook, we will use the API to [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/developers/) via its Python wrapper [PyMed](https://pypi.org/project/pymed/) to quickly gather large amounts of bibliometric metadata.\n"
