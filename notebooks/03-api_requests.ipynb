    "# Making API requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs on the web are also RESTful, so interacting with them works very similarly to interacting with a website. Whenever you use a data platform's search mask, chances are that this is just a browser-based frontend for the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the website of [Dartmouth's lookup service](https://lookup.dartmouth.edu/)\n",
    "- Open your browser's developer tools so we can inspect the requests (see [above](#http-demo))\n",
    "- Enter `Dartmouth Library` in the textbox and click `Search`\n",
    "- Inspect the request in the developer tools\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/demo-lookup-request.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the developer tools showing the response headers\" width=\"600\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "`https://api-lookup.dartmouth.edu/v1/lookup`: This is the base address of the lookup API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This base address is followed by a `q`, which indicates that the rest of the URL is a _query string_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A query string is a way to add additional information to a URL that the server can parse and use. This information must be structured as a pair of terms: The first term is the _key_, indicating what the second term represents, and the second term is the _value_, which is the actual bit of information we want to send.\n",
    "\n",
    "A query string can contain multiple parameters, which are separated by an `&`.\n",

    "We see this in the URL from our `GET` request:\n",
    "\n",
    "What we typed into the textbox was URL encoded (i.e., spaces are replaced with `%20` among other things) and sent to the server as a parameter named `q`. In addition, a number of parameters called `field` were added that appear to designate which fields we want to look up for the search term.\n",
