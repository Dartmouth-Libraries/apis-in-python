# APIs in Python

The vast realms of the internet are full of interesting structured and unstructured data. Sometimes these data are carefully curated and offered for download as a neatly bundled dataset. Often, however, what we are looking for is inconveniently spread out over many places. To name a few examples: Weather data, metadata for publications on Pubmed, or historic COVID-19 tracking data. Fortunately, many data sources offer access to their data through a different way than their websites: An Application Programming Interface (API). Using an API, you can make specific requests to obtain exactly the data you want, often at a large scale. Instead of combing through search results on a website and copying the data over to a table, you can, for example, use an API to automate the search and data extraction using just a few lines of code.

In this session, we will introduce the concepts involved in web API and walk through various examples using the Python programming language.

This session is intended for participants who have a basic understanding of the Python programming language. It is therefore a perfect follow-up to Introduction to Python.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Some basic Python programming knowledge is required to fully understand the example code. Consider the working through [Intro to Python(https://git.dartmouth.edu/lib-digital-strategies/RDS/workshops/computational-tools/intro-to-python] prior to this workshop.

The requirements for the Python code can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

The repo has the following structure:

- `ppt`: The slide deck used in the introduction
- `img`: Images used in the notebooks
- `notebooks`: Notebooks illustrating the main concepts discussed in this workshop
